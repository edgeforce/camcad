;as SMD for the keyword "technology" in the component section of the CCM file.  
;
;Rule #   Description
;
;     0   The input database must have the component flaged as SMD. 
;
;     1   If all pins of a component are SMD then the component is SMD.
;
;     2   If the majority of the pins of a component are SMD then the 
;         component is SMD.
