<P>Component shapes and types in PADS.</P>

<P>PADS has a section DECAL and PARTTYPE. </P>

<P>DECAL is the physical, graphic description of a shape (i.e. DIP14). </P>

<P>PARTTYPE is a defintion of components which used one or more decals (alternates). The PARTTYPE is what places the component. A PARTTYPE also can change pinnames of a DECAL. </P>

<P>CAMCAD does the following:</P>

<P>DECAL : All DECALS are converted to Geometries. </P>

<P>PARTTYPES : are attached as a ATT_TYPE to a component.</P>

<P>If a PARTTYPE has alphapins, a new GEOMETRY (DECAL) gets created called TYPE_DECAL and the component gets this Geometry attached.</P>

<P>The CAMCAD Typelist must have a unique identification between component and its defintion. PADS can change a PARTTYPE with alternate Decals.</P>

<P>Layernames:</P>

<P>Pads has layer numbers and layer classes. CAMCAD assigns the following names to these classes:</P>

<P>PADS Layer numbers used in DECAL section are called DECAL_nr</P>
