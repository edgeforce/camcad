<P>$#<IMG SRC="../images/bm0.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>  <B>Importing A Sample Gerber File</B></P>

<P>During the installation process, you have the option of installing various sample files to test in CAMCAD. If you have a shareware copy, your sample files are limited to DXF, Gerber, and HPGL files. If you have a full release, there are many more sample files to choose from.</P>

<P>This example, focuses on the Gerber sample files. If you did not select the Gerber files to be installed when you installed CAMCAD, you may use your own Gerber files.</P>

<P>1.In CAMCAD, select <B>File</B> &gt; <B>Import</B>. </P>

<P>The "Import File Format" window appears with two main viewing areas: </P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm2.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>The viewing area on the left lists all the modules that you are licensed for.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm2.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>The viewing area on the right lists all unlicensed modules. You cannot select anything unless you purchase the access code for that particular module.</P>

<P>2.In the left hand window, select <B>Gerber Read</B> and click <B>OK</B>. </P>

<P>3.In the Open dialog box, browse to find the "Gerber" subdirectory in the "Samples" directory. You will find that there are several .gbr files that you can select, and for this example, we will import all the Gerber files into one window. Single left click on the top file listed, which is probably drill.gbr. Then, move your mouse pointer to the last file listed, which is probably silk.gbr, and <I>hold the shift key down</I> while single left clicking on the file. The result is that all the .gbr files are selected. Click <B>Open</B>.</P>

<P>4.Next, a window appears called "Gerber Format.” This window is important because it allows you to toggle options on how you want the Gerber files to be imported. For now, the default selections are okay; however, if you want a more detailed description of what the selections mean, you can go to the readers/writers section of the Edition-specific help supplement, and investigate the Gerber entry listed for "Read/Import Modules.” Because the default selections are fine, you can just click <B>OK</B> to proceed. The .gbr files are then imported into CAMCAD. </P>

<P>Before the files are displayed on your screen, you are given choices on the placement of the imported files. The most common choice, and the one that you are likely to use for the vast majority of imports, is the top selection, <B>Place at ORIGIN and FIT PAGE to Image</B>. You may want to use the other selections when you are working with your actual files to be translated. In this case, select <B>Place at ORIGIN and FIT PAGE to Image</B>.</P>

<P>The .gbr files are now displayed on your screen.</P>

<P><B><IMG SRC="../images/bm1.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></B>When gerber files are imported and shown on your screen, numerous green circles with numbers inside display. These green circles indicate that you have undefined apertures. </P>

<P>To remove undefined apertures, see <U>Defining Undefined Apertures.</U></P>
