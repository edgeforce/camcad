<P>$#<B>Uninstallation Notes for CAMCAD</B></P>

<P>When CAMCAD is installed on your system, a file is created called delsL1.isu and is placed in the CAMCAD root directory. This file works in conjunction with the installation, and logs each file that is installed during the CAMCAD installation sequence. When an uninstallation occurs, the .isu file is called to coordinate what files are to be removed from your system.</P>

<P>When you work with CAMCAD, you may create new files that you store within the CAMCAD root directory or any of the subdirectories. These new files are obviously not recorded within the .isu file because they were created after the installation took place. When you run an uninstallation, all original files installed on your system will be removed, leaving any files that you created later intact. This is a safety precaution — we do not want to delete any files that you created and may consider important. </P>

<P>Simply use your file manager tool or Windows Explorer to navigate to the CAMCAD directory after you perform an uninstall, and take a look at the files that remain. If you need them, copy them to a safe directory, and only then delete the CAMCAD root directory and its subdirectories.</P>

<P>If you have installed multiple copies of CAMCAD on your system as you have upgraded from one version to the next, you will have multiple .isu files left over in your CAMCAD directory after you perform an uninstallation. These can all be safely deleted.</P>
