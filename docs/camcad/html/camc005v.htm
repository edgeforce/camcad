<P>The <B>Geometry List</B> can be found under <B>Tools &gt; Geometry List</B>. Depending on the kind of file you have imported into the project window, you will see different kinds of geometries. For example, if you have a Gerber and Aperture file loaded, you will see Apertures in the Geometry List. If you have a DXF file loaded, you will see inserted geometries / groups. </P>

<P><I>The Geometry List Dialog</I></P>

<P>Explore the <B>Geometry List</B> in detail. The left window indicates the file, and the right window indicates the loaded geometries. DXF files will probably all have different geometries, while Gerber files of the same design probably share the same geometries (apertures). The bottom of the window allows you to toggle on or off the various kinds of geometries. </P>

<P>You can set apertures as Tools in the Geometry List dialog. After performing any necessary editing, the resulting data can be exported as an Excellon Drill file.</P>

<P>Geometries can be created and manipulated in a variety of ways. Use the <B>Edit &gt; Edit Geometry</B> commands to gain use of geometries. </P>

<P>Import the sample DXF file called smallpcb.dxf. It is particularly helpful to be able to step inside geometries, to find out about the entities that create the geometry. Select a geometry in smallpcb.dxf and select <B>Edit &gt; Edit Geometry &gt; Edit Selected Geometry</B>. Individual components of the geometry can then be queried and edited. When finished editing the geometry, select <B>Edit &gt; Edit Geometry &gt; Done Editing Geometry</B>. </P>

<P><B>Note</B></P>

<P>When editing geometries in this fashion, it is helpful to use the Geometry Toolbar for shortcuts to the menu commands. Verify under <B>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Geometry Toolbar</B> that the toolbar is toggled on. </P>

<P>You may also Explode Selected Geometries, so that the entities are separated out permanently. </P>
