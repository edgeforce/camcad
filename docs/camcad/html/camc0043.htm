<P><B>•Angle</B>: Refers to the angle at which the line of text is drawn. For example, an angle setting of 0 means the line is written horizontally, while an angle setting of 90 will cause the text to be written vertically. </P>

<P><B>•Oblique</B>: Allows you to italicize your text. Positive entries in this field will result in text leaning to the right, and negative entries will cause the text to lean to the left. The useful range of settings is -50 to +50, with 0 being no lean.</P>
