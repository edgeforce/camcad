<H2>To edit an entity:</H2>

<P>1.Select an entity (see Selecting Entities). </P>

<P>2.Click <B>Edit Entity</B> (Ctrl + E). </P>

<P>3.Make modifications to database values.</P>

<P>4.Press <B>Modify</B>.</P>

<P>The values in the Edit Dialog represent true database values. This means that if the file is scaled, rotated, mirrored, or offset, these values will not correspond to the final coordinates. Likewise with geometries when in the geometry editor. For example, a block containing a circle of radius 1 is inserted with a scale of 10. Changing the radius of the circle to 2 would result in a circle with a radius of 20. Most types of entities have a width field. This can be modified by selecting a different width/aperture from the drop down or typing in a new size or name. Typing in a new size creates a new round width/aperture of this size. Typing in a new name creates a new width/aperture with size zero and undefined aperture shape.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm3.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0><B>Working with a Poly</B></P>

<P>A poly structure can have multiple polys in it. This is represented by a tree. Clicking on a vertex in this tree will draw a cross over that vertex in the drawing. The cross is drawn in the Marked Color. A line is drawn from this vertex to the next vertex to show which bulge/segment is affected by a change to this vertex bulge number.To edit a vertex coordinate or bulge number, click on the vertex in the tree and click <B>Edit Poly Item</B>. To edit a poly width, Closed, Filled, or Void, click on the poly in the tree and click <B>Edit Poly Item</B>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm3.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0><B>Attributes</B></P>

<P>Click <B>Attribs</B> to modify this entitys attributes.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm3.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0><B>Editing Apertures</B></P>

<P>Modifying an apertures size or shape from the Edit Aperture Flash Dialog makes changes to the aperture. This means that these types of changes will affect all flashes and draws of this aperture.See also <U>Poly&gt;Edit FunctionsGeometry&gt;Edit.</U> </P>
