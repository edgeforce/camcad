<P>In CAMCAD, all polyline draws will follow the following rules:</P>

<P>•All verticies which are not endpoints will be displayed as round.</P>

<P>•Endpoints of lines and polylines will be displayed as Round, Square, or Endcap.</P>

<P>•For polylines drawn with a Round or Square aperture, all verticies will be displayed as round. For polylines drawn with a Rectangle aperture, all verticies will be displayed as square.</P>

<P>•Square line ends will be handled with a rotated aperture.</P>

<P>•Endcap line ends will be handled with a rotated aperture.</P>

<P><B>Gerber Output Rules:</B></P>

<P>•<U>Extended (RS274x) Gerber Output</U>: Extended Gerber output must support rotated apertures</P>

<P>•<U>Standard (RS274) Gerber Output</U>: Must warn users if non-othogonal lines and/or polylines drawn with a Square or Endcap exist. These features will be assigned a new round aperture of same width as the original geometry </P>

<P><B>Rotated Apertures In General:</B></P>

<P>Square and round apertures can be handled by CAMCAD. Rectangular apertures cannot be rotated.</P>
