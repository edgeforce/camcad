<H4>How Commands are Described</H4>

<P>When navigating through a series of commands to perform an action, shortened annotation is used. For example, the command sequence for opening the help file - "<I>Find and click on the word Help on the menu bar to drop down a list of choices, and select Index</I>" will be shortened to "select  <B>Help &gt; Index</B>." Similarly, importing an HPGL file will be written as"select  <B>File &gt; Import &gt; HPGL Read</B>"<B> </B>instead of "<I>On the menu bar click on File, then select Import, and then select HPGL Read.”</I> </P>
