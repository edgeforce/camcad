<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm2.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Unlicensed</P>

<P>Choose your file type from the selections on the Licensed side. If the type you are looking for is on the Unlicensed side, contact RSI to obtain the proper export module access code.</P>

<P><B><IMG SRC="../images/bm1.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></B>Depending on the file type you choose for the export, you may have a dialog box that comes up to change export parameters. Usually the defaults are fine to use; however, you may want to explore the "Write/Export Modules" section of this help file to find out the specifics of the export parameters for each export module that we offer.</P>

<P>3.Choose a filename and location for the exported file. </P>

<P>Default file extensions are automatically assigned, such as .asc, .brd, .gbr, or .plt, depending on the export format that you choose. </P>

<P><B><IMG SRC="../images/bm1.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></B>You do not have to use these extensions, and you may choose whatever file name that works best for you.</P>
