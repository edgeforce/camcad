<P>CAMCAD Read/Import NameR-EIF</P>

<P>Full CAD Format NameVeriBest PCB</P>

<P>Supported Versions1.0, VB14</P>

<P>Hardware PlatformWorkstation, PC</P>

<P>Operating SystemUNIX, Windows-NT</P>

<P>Database ClassNet: Connections are allowed to be made in any order and “T” connections are also allowed. Although rules must be followed for trace routing and via placement they are usually very loose, thus allowing the designer much more freedom in the routing process.</P>

<P>Board Outline ClassReal: Board outlines in this CAD format are true board outline entities.  CAMCAD supports true board outlines.</P>

<P>Component ClassLibrary: Library driven CAD systems have a component library section within the CAD data which defines all components.</P>

<P><B>Importing Veribest into CAMCAD</B></P>

<P><B>File(s) Used For Import</B></P>

<P>Files Generated by VB2RSI from the VeriBest system:</P>

<P>•eifo_cor.txt — EIF Correspondence file</P>

<P>•eifo_tec.txt — Job Parameters Technology file</P>

<P>•eifo_pad.txt — Pad Table file</P>

<P>•eifo_pin.txt — Pin Table file</P>

<P>•eifo_cel.txt — Cell Library file</P>

<P>•eifo_des.txt  — VeriBest PCB Design File(design.vbd)</P>

<P>•eifo_clr.txt — Job Parameters Clearances file</P>

<P>•netlist.kyn — Keyin Netlist (renamed from Netlist.txt or Netlist.aug)</P>

<P><B>How To Produce File(s)</B></P>

<P>For all CAMCAD products purchased with the VeriBest EIF import option, RSI will provide a zip archive with the utilities necessary to produce the EIF design files from the VeriBest design.</P>

<P>The zip archive VB972RSI.ZIP, contains a VB2RSI.doc file which documents the usage of the VB2RSI.exe and NETLIST.exe files. Follow the instructions to produce the EIF files for use with CAMCAD.</P>

<P><B>Notes On File Generation</B></P>

<P>Only one file, the EIFO_COR.txt file (same as the VeriBest Correspondence file), needs to be imported into CAMCAD. This file calls all of the other files in their proper order so that they are all imported correctly into CAMCAD. These should all reside in a design directory. The NETLIST.txt or NETLIST.aug file must be renamed to NETLIST.kyn and reside in the design directory.</P>

<P>The file import process is incremental; if you need to import any extra files after the correspondence file is imported (such as a netlist file) you can select File &gt; Import &gt; Veribest (EIF) Read again, and import the extra file.</P>

<P><B>Items controlled by the Eif.IN file</B></P>

<P><B>.LAYERATTR</B></P>

<P>This command sets the default layers which will be identified as PAD TOP, PAD BOTTOM, and PAD INNER.</P>

<P><B>.MIRRORLAYER</B></P>

<P>Establishes default layer mirroring.</P>

<P><B>.UNNAMEDNET</B></P>

<P>When nets are found which begin with the string given, CAMCAD will rename that net to $$__device.pin, where device.pin is the first device pin on that net.</P>

<P><B>.TESTPAD</B></P>
