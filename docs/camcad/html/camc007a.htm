<H4>$#<IMG SRC="../images/bm0.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>  Importing and Printing an HPGL File</H4>

<P>A common use of CAMCAD for HP Test, in addition to generating board and board_xy files, is to load an HPGL file generated by Board Consultant or Fixture Consultant and print it to any Windows-supported printer. These files are given the extension ".p" from the HP3070 generate plot command in the BT Basic environment. The normal files are board_xy.p, board_xytop.p, probes.p, inserts.p, wires.p and alignment.p.</P>

<P>CAMCAD is expecting an extension of .hp or .hpl for the import file selection filter. You can rename the import file extensions or simply change the Import Filter to *.p so the files are visible in the Open File dialog box.</P>

<P><B>To import and print the HPGL file:</B></P>

<P>1.Select<B> File &gt; New</B> to open a new CAMCAD document.</P>

<P>2.Select <B>File &gt; Import</B>,  then click <B>HPGL/HPGL-2 Read</B>). The Open dialog box appears.</P>

<P>3.In the Open dialog box, locate and select the HPGL file to be imported.</P>

<P>4.Click <B>OK</B> on the HPGL Import File Format dialog box. For a description of the options on this dialog, see the Standard CAMCAD Help file.</P>

<P>CAMCAD reads the file and a dialog box with file placement options displays.</P>

<P>5.CAMCAD reads the file and a dialog box with file placement options displays. Click <B>Place</B> at ORIGIN and FIT PAGE to Image.</P>

<P>6.Zoom to the area of the display that should be printed. If the entire image is to be printed, you may skip this step.</P>

<P>7.Select <B>File &gt; Print</B>.<B> </B>Select the appropriate options in the Print dialog box, then click <B>OK</B>. </P>

<P>See the CAMCAD Help Reference file for a description of all Print options. Normally, Print to Scale should be selected and the scale set to 1 (default). </P>

<P><B><IMG SRC="../images/bm198.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></B>A Print to Scale with the scale set to 1 provides a 1 to 1 plot that can be overlaid against the PCB for testing to verify the validity of the fixture design. </P>

<P><B><IMG SRC="../images/bm198.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></B>Use the Print Preview command to ensure both the proper orientation of the print and the correct number of pages. </P>

<P>8.A second Print dialog box displays which displays printer choices. Select the appropriate printer, then click <B>OK</B>.</P>

<P>The file will be sent to the selected printer.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm1.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>You may print at any scale. If the scale is too large for the selected output device, CAMCAD automatically separates the plot into multiple sheets.</P>
