<P>When you first install CAMCAD, you have the option of choosing a single user setup or a network setup. </P>

<P><B>•Single User Setups: </B>If you are installing CAMCAD to a single machine for a single user, you must select single user setup. The single user setup gives you the option of selecting the installed sample files, and creates all the necessary program file icons and program groups for you to use CAMCAD. </P>

<P><B>•Network Setups: </B>If you have purchased the CAMCAD network module, and have been sent your customized CAMCAD network file, you may select the network setup. CAMCAD can be installed to a network when there are multiple users wishing to use it. See <U>CAMCAD network information / tips</U>.</P>
