<P>Allows a network administrator to set and change a password necessary to enter or modify access codes.</P>

<P>When CAMCAD is first installed on a network, the network administrator sets up each client station with the Setupusr program. Immediately after running the setupusr.exe, the administrator should enter in the access codes for the modules that will run at that station. After the access codes are entered, the network administrator can set a password that will protect the access codes just entered. Once the password is established at that machine, the access codes cannot be altered unless the correct password is keyed in.</P>

<P>Any local user machine that the network administrator wishes to 'protect' should have a password established.</P>
