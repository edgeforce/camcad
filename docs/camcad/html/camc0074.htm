<P>On initial import, the document has all the design layers displayed. Generally, a test engineer is not interested in the trace, unroute, copper pour area, mechanical diagram, miscellaneous documentation, or note layers. These layers fill the database with items not normally important to testing and tend to clutter the image and make redrawing a slow process. </P>

<P>You can delete the non-useful items. However, you do want to preserve the primary board outline.</P>
