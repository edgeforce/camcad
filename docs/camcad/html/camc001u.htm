<H2>In CAMCAD, the project window is composed of individual files that you can toggle on and off, just as each individual file is composed of layers that you can toggle on and off. When you add a new file, you can add entities and make changes to this new file without affecting your original files. This is extremely helpful for editing purposes.</H2>
