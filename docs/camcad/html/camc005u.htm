<P>Many different file formats contain multiple layers of data. Each layer has a separate name, and is represented graphically by different colors. All of the layers contained within all of the files currently loaded into the project window are visible with the <B>Tools &gt; Layer List</B> command.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm192.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><I>The Layer List Dialog </I></P>

<P>Individual layers can be toggled on or off, and specific information regarding each layer can be set. At the left side of the Layer List window, the layer number is on a button. Click on a layer button. </P>
