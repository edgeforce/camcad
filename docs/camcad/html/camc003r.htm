<P>Internally, CAMCAD has many class settings that you can use to flag particular entities. This optional flag will allow you to manipulate entities displayed in the project window with unparalleled precision. You can turn classes on and off in CAMCAD, just the same way you can turn layers or files on and off. If you want to display only certain entites from multiple layers or files, set those entities to a single class, then turn off all classes except that one. The resulting project window display will contain exactly the information you need.</P>
