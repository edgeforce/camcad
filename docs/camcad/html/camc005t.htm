<P>$#<IMG SRC="../images/bm0.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>  <B>Working With Files</B></P>

<P>Importing/reading a file is the first step in working with files. Review the pages <B><U>Importing A Sample DXF File</U></B> and <B><U>Importing A Sample Gerber File</U></B> in the <B>QuickStart</B> section of the CAMCAD Help Reference. As a general rule, importing a file is a four step process:</P>

<P>1.Select <B>File &gt; Import</B> and choose the desired format from the dialog. The available formats will appear in the left side of the window, and the unavailable formats will appear in the right side of the window.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm188.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><I>The Import File Format Dialog</I></P>

<P>2.The <B>Open </B>dialog box appears. Navigate to the desired file and select it.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm189.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><I>The Open File Dialog</I></P>

<P>3.Import format options display. Each type of file format has different import options. Generally, the default selections will be fine to start with, but occasionally they must be modified in order to import the file correctly.</P>

<P>4.After the import format options are set, you are asked for the desired placement of the file. Selections include:</P>

<P>•Place at Origin and Fit Page to Image</P>

<P>•Place with Moues</P>

<P>•Place at Origin</P>

<P>•Fit Image to Page.</P>

<P>For ease of use within the CAMCAD environment, it is recommended that you choose <B>Place at Origin and Fit Page to Image.</B></P>

<P>Before your file is displayed on the screen, you may see a log file open up in Notepad. The log file details specific information regarding the import process. <I>It is important to note that the log file is <U>not</U> a listing of import errors</I>. Rather, sometimes CAMCAD will skip or alter unnecessary or bad information in order to successfully import a file. <B>The log file is simply a listing what CAMCAD had to do in order to import the file as it did.</B></P>

<P>Your file will then be displayed on the screen. Multiple files can be displayed within the CAMCAD project window, such as multiple Gerber files. Simply repeat the import process for each file you wish to import into CAMCAD. </P>

<P>Multiple project windows can be opened within CAMCAD. Open a new project window with the <B>File &gt; New</B> command. Each project window can have an unlimited number of files in any combination of file formats. Individual project windows may be selected under <B>Window &gt; [desired window name]</B>. Toggle various displays of the project windows with the <B>Windows &gt; Tile Vertically</B>, <B>Windows &gt; Tile Horizontally</B>, and <B>Windows &gt; Cascade</B> commands.</P>

<P>Some file-specific and view-specific functions are detailed below:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm190.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><I>The File List Dialog</I></P>

<P>Explore the <B>File List</B> dialog, found under <B>Tools &gt; File List</B>. The File List will show each file that is currently opened in the project window. Immediately to the left of the file name you will see either ON or OFF, depending on whether the file is turned on or off. You can toggle the display of any file by single-clicking this word.</P>

<P>The File List dialog also allows you to edit the <I>X,Y insertion point, the rotation, the scale, and the mirroring status of the file</I>. Select a file and choose <B>MODIFY</B>. A small window will appear with fields that may be modified. Make any necessary changes and choose <B>DONE</B>. When the File List dialog is closed, you will see the changes take effect.</P>

<P>The manipulation of settings in the <B>File List</B> may alter the way the file is shown on the screen (i.e. mirroring). It may be necessary to reset the page dimensions in order to display the file properly. Select <B>Settings &gt; Modify Settings</B> from the menu commands. On the <B>Page </B>tab, you will see the current max/min X and Y coordinates for the page. Click on the button called <B>Fit Page To Image</B>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm191.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P><I>The Settings &gt; Modify Settings Dialog</I></P>

<P>Zoom in/out/window/extents commands are offered, with buttons on the Main Toolbar. Use these to alter your view of your file. To navigate about your file, you may also find the commands <I>Pan to Center, Pan to Coordinate, Pan to Text, and Pan to Reference Designator</I> helpful. They all are found under the Zoom commands from the menu commands.</P>

<P>Explore the <B>View commands</B> from the menu commands. <B>View &gt; Toolbars</B> shows all available toolbars; toggle the display of a toolbar by selecting it. Toolbars, once visible, may be repositioned on the screen by grabbing them with the mouse cursor and dragging to a new location. Other View commands toggle the display of <I>graphic classes and insert types, show fill styles, and copy images to the clipboard</I>.</P>
