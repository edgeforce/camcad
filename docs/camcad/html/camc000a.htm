<P><B>CAMCAD Shareware</B></P>

<P>The shareware version of CAMCAD will create a program group called "CAMCAD Shareware" for Windows 3.x or Windows NT. Inside the program group there will be an icon for uninstalling CAMCAD. Windows95 users should double click on the "Add/Remove Programs" icon in the Control Panel window, and select "CAMCAD Demonstration Copy.” Each time you get a new version of the shareware, it is highly recommended you uninstall the old copy before you install the new one. We also recommend uninstalling the shareware copy if you are installing CAMCAD Professional.</P>

<P><B>CAMCAD Full Release Editions</B></P>

<P>CAMCAD Graphic, Professional, 3D-ECAD, PCB Translator, and HP3070 will have icons and program groups created for running CAMCAD during the installation process. Windows 3.x or Windows NT3.51 users will find the icon for uninstallation in the CAMCAD group. Windows95 &amp; NT4.0 users should double click on the <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> icon in the Control Panel window, and select the CAMCAD entry for uninstallation. </P>

<P>Each time you get a new version of CAMCAD, you should select the same directory for each CAMCAD installation. The installation will only copy and update files which are newer than the ones already installed on your system - significantly decreasing the time it takes to upgrade CAMCAD. Furthermore, if you always install CAMCAD to the same directory, you will not have to re-enter your access codes each time you upgrade to a newer version. </P>

<P>When you uninstall CAMCAD, it may not completely remove all the files from your system. To complete the uninstallation process, simply delete any unnecessary remaining files or directories from your system. For insight as to why you may need to manually delete these remaining files, see <U>Uninstallation.</U></P>
