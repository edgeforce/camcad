<P><B>$#</B><IMG SRC="../images/bm0.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>  <B>Top Ten Frequently Asked Questions</B></P>

<P><B>1) Why are my thermals coming in as undefined when I import my Gerber-X (RS274x) file?</B></P>

<P>When you first read in your Gerber file, there is a checkbox next to an option called "Macro Defined Thermal, Moire." Try re-reading in your Gerber file, making sure this checkbox is <I>not</I> checked. </P>

<P><B>2) I tried to install CAMCAD on a Win. 3.1x machine, but the install would not run. How do you get CAMCAD installed on a Win. 3.1x machine?</B></P>

<P>Starting with CAMCAD V. 2.20a, we no longer support Windows 3.1x. Microsoft no longer supports the 32-bit patch Win32s, and there are technical problems associated with this file. CAMCAD will run on true 32-bit platforms, including Windows 95, 98, and NT.</P>

<P><B>3) How would I go about defining custom HPGL and Gerber file extensions in CAMCAD, so when I import those files, CAMCAD will automatically be looking for the proper files?</B></P>

<P>Step one is to save the current setup by issuing the <B>Settings &gt; Save Settings</B> command. Next, open the new file in a text editor, such as MS WordPad. Among the other settings, you will see a section called "File Extensions." Type in your modifications and save the file. Note: Only HPGL and Gerber files can have custom extension modification.</P>

<P><B>4) What is the difference between highlighted &amp; marked entities?</B></P>

<P>In CAMCAD it is possible to have multiple entities marked — hold down the <B>Shift</B> key as you are clicking on the entities to mark them. When you toggle certain commands, like move or delete, these commands will apply to <I>all</I> marked entities. </P>

<P>The last entity to be marked is the one that is considered highlighted, which is relevant to other single-entity commands like query. </P>

<P><B>5) I have an older copy of CAMCAD installed on my system. When I downloaded and installed the new shareware or the new Professional version of CAMCAD, I no longer am able to run the old copy. Why can't I run the old version anymore?</B></P>

<P>New versions of CAMCAD have more toolbars than older versions, a fact that Windows does not handle very well. If you need to regain functionality of the old version of CAMCAD, there is a way to do it involving editing either the Win Registry or the camcad.ini file, depending on what operating system you are running. You can call RSI technical support for details, but we always recommend running the newest version of CAMCAD.</P>

<P><B>6) When I import my DXF or Gerber files, line ends that should be square appear rounded. Why is this happening?</B></P>

<P>This was a known issue with certain early releases of CAMCAD V. 2.1. This issue has been resolved, and all current releases of CAMCAD will display line ends properly.</P>

<P><B>7) After I read in my Gerber file, I see a bunch of green circles with numbers inside. What are these circles, and how do I get rid of them?</B></P>

<P>These green circles represent undefined apertures. Review the sections in this help file called <I><U>Defining Undefined Apertures</U> </I>and <I><U>Aperture Read</U></I>.</P>

<H4>8) I am using the CEdit module to make changes and additions to my file. Some commands dealing with editing do not seem to turn off, such as inserting a line segment. How do I turn off these commands?</H4>

<P>Some commands place you in certain CAMCAD "modes,” such as <B>Add &gt; Line Segment </B>or <B>Edit &gt; Move Poly Vertex</B>. To exit from these modes, either issue the command again to turn it off or press [<B>ESC</B>] key. </P>

<P><B>9) What modules are necessary to perform basic functions, and what kind of module packages does RSI offer?</B></P>

<P>The lowest level of functionality with CAMCAD occurs at the shareware level, where CAMCAD acts <I>only</I> as a viewer. One step up occurs with the addition of the <B>CPRINT</B> module, where you gain the ability to print the contents of the project window to any standard printer, to the clipboard, or export in .BMP format. </P>

<P>Functionality greatly increases with the addition of the <B>WGRAPH</B> and <B>CEDIT</B> modules. <B>WGRAPH</B> allows for exporting to DXF, Gerber, or HPGL/HPGL-2 formats, while <B>CEDIT</B> gives the ability to modify and change your files, such as select and move entities from one layer to another.</P>

<P>It is very common to purchase <B>CPRINT</B>, <B>WGRAPH</B>, and <B>CEDIT</B> together in one package. We call this bundle <B>CAMEDIT</B>. </P>

<P>Of course, CAMCAD functionality extends well beyond this level. No matter what translation service you need, we may have a package just right for you. For further details, please contact RSI sales at (800) 766-1230 or sales@rsi-inc.com. </P>

<P><B>10) How do I enter in my access codes to use the modules I purchased?</B></P>

<P>Access codes can be entered in the <B>Help &gt; About CAMCAD &amp; Access Codes</B> section of CAMCAD. For further information, see the help file entries <I><U>Help &gt; About CAMCAD &amp; Access Codes</U></I> and <I><U>Entering Access Codes</U></I>. </P>
