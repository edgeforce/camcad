<H2>Allows you to load in a CAMCAD font file. </H2>

<H2>CAMCAD is shipped with a font file called default.fnt, and several more .fnt files are available for download at the RSI web site. Additionally, there is also a file for download called fontgen.exe, which is the CAMCAD font file generator. You can use this program to read in any true-type font (.ttf) file and convert it to the CAMCAD readable .fnt format.</H2>
