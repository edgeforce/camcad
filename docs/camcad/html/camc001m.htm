<P>Selects different entities within the crosshairs.</P>

<P>Many times you will want to query on something in the project window, yet because entities overlap or are on top of each other, selecting the specific entity for querying is difficult. </P>

<H3>To select the desired entity:</H3>

<P>1.Move the CAMCAD crosshairs to the area where your entity is located, and click the left mouse button.</P>

<P>2.If your target object is not highlighted, repeatedly press the [<B>F3</B>] shortcut key. Each time you press [<B>F3</B>], a different entity within the crosshairs area becomes selected. Continue pressing [<B>F3</B>] until the entity that you want is selected.</P>
